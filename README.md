## Projects
- [Building a model to predict football match results](https://github.com/zhukvv/Football_match_results_forecast): It was the most challenging project at that moment for me because building models is something that I'm only learning to do. To be precise, not just build them, but understand them.
- ["It's not a pancake" bliny fast food restaurant opening in the US](https://github.com/zhukvv/Bliny-restaurant-grand-opening): My first project where I used Python to analyse data.
- [My first project at the data analytics course](https://github.com/zhukvv/Airbnb-rent): Using a SQL database and Excel skills, I had to analyze the list of flats and choose suitable ones according to the requirements given.
